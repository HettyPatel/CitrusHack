## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from the growing concern for the environment and the need for better waste management solutions. By leveraging the power of machine learning and AI, we saw an opportunity to positively impact the planet while also improving the efficiency and effectiveness of waste management processes. We believe technology can play a crucial role in creating a more sustainable future, and we are passionate about using our skills and expertise to make a difference.

## What it does
The real-time waste detection machine learning program uses advanced AI algorithms to identify and sort various types of waste materials in real time. This helps to reduce waste volume and enable efficient recycling. The program can be integrated into waste management systems, allowing for more efficient and effective waste management processes. By accurately identifying and sorting different types of waste, the program can also help to reduce contamination and increase the value of recycled materials. Overall, the program aims to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future by improving waste management practices.

## How we built it
Building the real-time waste detection machine learning program involved several steps. Initially, a preexisting dataset was identified and gathered, and additional data were collected to enhance the dataset. The collected data was then annotated manually to enable supervised learning.

The YOLOv8 algorithm was chosen for training the model due to its efficiency and accuracy in object detection tasks. The algorithm was fine-tuned on the annotated dataset, optimizing the model's performance.

A script was developed using the trained model to enable real-time detection, allowing the program to identify and sort waste materials in real time. Overall, this involved a combination of data collection, annotation, algorithm selection, and script development in creating a functional and efficient real-time waste detection machine learning program.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of the real-time waste detection machine learning program, we encountered several challenges. One of the biggest challenges was the availability of a limited amount of data, which made it difficult to train the model effectively. This required us to gather and manually annotate additional data to enhance the dataset.

Another challenge was poorly labeled data, which caused the model's performance inaccuracies. To address this, we had to review and correct the data labeling manually.

Manually labeling data was a time-consuming process and required a significant amount of human resources, which was also a challenge. However, it was necessary to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.

Overall, these challenges required significant effort and resources to overcome but were crucial in developing a high-quality real-time waste detection machine learning program.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have developed a functional and efficient real-time waste detection machine learning program. Our program uses advanced AI algorithms to accurately identify and sort various types of waste materials in real time, enabling more efficient and effective waste management practices.

We are also proud of the data collection and annotation process, which involved manually gathering and annotating a significant amount of data to enhance the dataset. This process was crucial in improving the accuracy of the model and ensuring that it could identify a wide range of waste materials.

Furthermore, our program has the potential to make a significant positive impact on the environment by reducing waste volume and enabling efficient recycling. Our program can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future by optimizing waste management practices.

Overall, we are proud of our team's hard work and dedication to developing a real-time waste detection machine learning program that can positively impact the world.

## What we learned
Developing the real-time waste detection machine learning program was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught us several valuable lessons. Here are some of the key takeaways from our project:

1. Data collection and annotation are crucial for building accurate and effective machine learning models.
2. Even with pre-existing datasets, manual annotation and collection of additional data may be necessary to achieve the desired accuracy.
3. Proper labeling and cleaning of data can significantly improve model performance.
4. The selection of appropriate algorithms and optimization techniques is critical to achieving high-quality results.
5. Real-time detection requires efficient script development and optimization for performance.
6. Sustainability should be at the forefront of technological development, and AI can play a crucial role in creating a more environmentally friendly future.

## What's Next for Waste Detection
The next step for waste detection could involve the development of an embedded system that can be mounted onto a drone to detect waste in hard-to-reach areas. This would allow for more efficient and effective waste detection and management, particularly in areas that are difficult or dangerous to access by traditional means.

An embedded system on a drone could use similar real-time waste detection technology to the program we developed but with the added benefit of mobility and access to difficult-to-reach areas. The drone could fly over areas such as forests, beaches, and waterways, identifying and locating waste materials that may have been previously undetected. This could significantly improve waste management practices and help to preserve natural environments.

Developing an embedded system on a drone would require additional work on optimizing and integrating the waste detection algorithm into a drone's control system. Additionally, ethical considerations such as privacy concerns and safety issues should be addressed. However, this technology has the potential to revolutionize waste detection and management practices, providing a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future for us all.
