*TACO is a growing image dataset of trash in the wild. It contains segmented images of litter taken under diverse environments: woods, roads and beaches. These images are manually labeled according to an hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms. Annotations are provided in a similar format to COCO dataset.*
